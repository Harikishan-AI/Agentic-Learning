Renamed Bloomberg LP in 1986, about 10,000 of the company's terminals were installed on the desks of financial professionals by 1991. The company continues to provide financial and other news through its website, bloomberg.com. You can invest in Bloomberg-like companies that provide similar services such as Thomson Reuters and Morningstar. If you're an investor who is intrigued by how diverse Bloomberg seems and how much money it makes, and would like to invest in a similar public entity, you may look to financial services firms that provide news, data, and analytics, such as Thomson Reuters or Morningstar.\",\n",
